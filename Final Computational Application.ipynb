    "Gene Mutation and the field of Genetics are of significant value to our society due to their contribution to fields like paleontology, agronomy, medicine, forensics, etc. Genealogical mutation sequencing, thus, becomes essential in understanding the relationship between organisms their DNA sequences, and our understanding of the world. As such, this report aims to document the investigations performed to produce a program to map the relationship between different DNA sequences that may have undergone mutations from one another. These mutations occur randomly and involve the deletion of an existing character, the insertion of a new character, or the change of an existing character into another one.\n",
    "Given a set of seven sequences, the program must determine which sequences are 'most similar' to each other to identify the parent sequence from which two children sequences were produced after a set of mutations, which then produced two grandchildren sequences (two grandchildren sequences from each children sequence) after undergoing mutations again. This report introduces the concept of the Longest Common Subsequence as a way to measure similarity and develops local and global strategies for reconstructing the genealogy of the seven given sequences. An evaluation of both approaches is provided explaining which decision variables affect the choice of one algorithmic approach over another. Finally, the genealogical relationship of these seven sequences is employed to estimate the probabilities of an insertion, deletion, or mutation occurring for each character of a mutating sequence. "

    "Similarity between a pair of gene sequences can be defined in terms of their longest common subsequence (LCS). An LCS of sequences X and Y is a subsequence Z of elements that are contained in both X and Y, in a strictly increasing order of indices for each. These elements, however, may or may not be consecutive to each other in either of the input gene sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if X = {G, C, C, T, C} and Y = {G, A, C, C}, the longest common subsequence between the two will be z = {G, C, C} as it is the longest subsequence of elements present in both X and Y which are in strictly increasing order of their respective indices (although not necessarily consecutively). The longer the LCS relative to the length of the input sequences, the more similar the sequences are. \n",

    "The function common_longest_subsequence() returns all longest common subsequences (LCSs) for a pair of sequences and their length. To do so, this function implements a dynamic programming approach which first constructs a matrix with shape ($m_1$, $m_2$) where $m_1$ represents the number of items in one of the sequences in the pair and $m_2$ represents the number of items in the other. This matrix, c, will store the length of the LCS for the combination of characters up to c[i][j] where i and j are the indices of the characters in the sequences which can take values from 0 to $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. It does so by examining the contiguous cells to the left and above the one being calculated, benefiting from the overlap of subproblems. By following this approach, the bottom right corner cell in our matrix c will hold the value of the length of the LCS between the two sequences. \n",

For each cell in the matrix, the procedure checks whether the characters of both sequences in those positions are the same, in which case it means that such character belongs in the LCS. If this condition is met, the character is appended to the LCS and the procedure moves to evaluating the cell diagonally contiguous to the top-right corner of the recently evaluated cell. However, if the characters of the sequences for that cell of the matrix are not the same, the procedure will choose between continuing traversing the matrix toward the cell contiguous to the left of the current one, above the current one, or both. To determine this, it will check which of the two cells has a higher LCS length value and select the one with the highest one. If both cells have the same LCS value, it will recursively traverse both paths: the one from the cell to the left and the one from the cell above. The possibility of evaluating both paths is what allows for more than one LCS of the same length to be retrieved.\n",

Our problem exhibits an optimal substructure property if its optimal solution contains the optimal solutions of subproblems within it. To demonstrate that this is the case we must identify the global solution to the overall problem, and prove that it contains optimal solutions to subproblems within it. The global solution to this problem (which can also be found in the fifth test case of Appendix A) is {A, B, A}, {A, c, A} where both subsequences are LCSs of X and Y. \n",

For example, in order to compute the LCSs for the subproblem for the pair of sequences {A, C, B} and {A, B} we will need to consider the solution to the subsubproblem for the pair {A, C} and {A}. If we store the solution to this subsubproblem, which is an LCS of {A}, we can then use to build upon it when computing the LCS between {A, C, B} and {A, B} which will be the solution of extending the solution to {A, C} and {A} (found to be {A}) when adding the next character common in both sequences (which in this case is 'B') yielding a solution to the subproblem {A, B}. This same subsubproblem: the pair {A, C} and {A} will appear in other subproblems, for example {A, C} and {A, B} whose solution will be the result of extending the solution to the subsubproblem {A, C} and {A} (found to be {A}) when adding the next character common in both sequences (which in this case does not exist as the addition of the character 'B' to the second sequence did not result in any other common characters in both). \n",

This matrix represents all possible subproblems as each of its cells, where c[i][j] considers all the characters for the first sequence up to the index i and all the characters up to the index j for the second sequence. It benefits from the overlapping subproblem by accessing the cells whose LCS lengths have already been computed multiple times. Depending on the following conditions: 1) if the characters of both sequences at indices i and j are the same, 2) else if the value of the cell contiguous to the left of the current cell has a lower value than the cell contiguous above, 3) else if the value of the cell contiguous to the left of the current cell has a higher value than the cell contiguous above (if the values of the cells contiguous left and above are the same, the value of the current cell will be the same) it computes the value of the current cell by: 1) adding 1 to the value of the cell diagonally top-left of the current one, 2) keeping the same value as the cell contiguous above or 3) keeping the same value as the cell contiguous to the left, respectively. This means that depending on which condition is met, a given cell could potentially be accessed to assist in the process of computing a cell contigous below it, contiguous to its right, or contiguous diagonally to its bottom-right corner (given that it is not in any of the borders of the matrix), optimizing the calculation of up to three other subproblems, while always yielding the optimal solution.\n",

This genealogical relationship can be derived from an analysis of the similarity among sequences, for which LCS lengths can be an informative matrix. To produce the matrix of LCS lengths for all pairs of these seven sequences in set_strings, however, we do not need to compute all LCS for each pair of sequences as they all have the same length. Thus, we employ the function lcs_length_calculator() to return the length of a LCS of any given pair of sequences, following the same procedure as to build matrix c in the function longest_common_subsequence. The function lengths_matrix() produces a matrix for a given set of sequences, storing all LCS lengths for all the combinations of the sequences inputted. These procedures can be found in Appendix A. When running lengths_matrix() on set_strings, it produces the matrix shown in Figure 1.\n",

Simply comparing the lengths of LCS of different pairs to each other may be misleading, as some are significantly longer than others (insertions and deletions may alter sequence lengths). A more accurate measure of the similarity between two sequences is the length of their LCS relative to the lengths of the original sequences. For the purpose of this report, whenever mentioned 'relative LCS' refers to the longest common subsequence for two sequences relative to the average lengths of those two sequences. As such, we must reproduce the sequences matrix, dividing the LCS by the average of its input sequences so that we can work with this new metric. \n",

In this case, the metric is the relative LCS length for that sequence and another given sequence. This strategy is implemented through a greedy algorithm that for each node, identifies another node with which it shares the highest LCS and saves it as its parent. Let us examine its procedure. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The algorithm starts by identifying the number of leaf nodes that the genealogical tree will have and which sequences belong to those leaf nodes. This process is based on the assumption that the more generations away from the root node a sequence is, the more mutations it has undergone, and as such, the more variance it will have among the LCSs with all other sequences. Thus, the procedure first computes the mean LCS for each sequence, and its standard deviation and then calculates how many standard deviations away the longest positive LCS for that sequence is away from the mean, storing these values in a dictionary. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Once the algorithm identifies the number of leaf nodes for the tree we are calculating, it selects that number of nodes and following our local metric, for each of those nodes identifies which other node is most similar to it, meaning has the longest relative LCS in common. Because all these nodes have been identified as leaf nodes, we know that the sequences identified as most closely related must necessarily be their parent sequences. When all these connections have been drawn out, we need to make sure that no violations have occurred. Violations, in the context of this algorithmic approach, result from cases where not all pairs of children share a parent, in which case, we would find at least two parent nodes with only one child node associated with them. This becomes a problem as the algorithm assumes that the tree is complete and there is a 2 to 1 ratio between the number of children nodes and the number of their parent nodes, meaning that each level, starting to count from the bottom of the tree, will have half the nodes as the previous level did. If these violations are not fixed, the algorithm will fail to produce a tree as it will run out of available nodes when mapping the relationships at the next level of the tree. To fix violations, the function fix_violations() identifies which parent nodes have only one child (if any), selects half of them to be completed, reasigning the children accordingly, and ensures to make the remaining parent nodes are available again to be considered when identifying relationships at the next level. Once all children have been correctly assigned to their parents, we can remove all leaf node sequences from the pool of sequences whose position in the tree we must identify and move on to identify all the connections of the nodes that fall in the next level.\n",

To do so, it will again identify which out of the available sequences remaining has the longest relative LCS for that sequence and select it as the parent node, updating the variables that store which sequences are still available and which sequences have been used. Once there is only one sequence left whose parent relationship has not been determined, the procedure identifies it as the root of the tree and prints out its relationships. \n",

To prove that this is the case let's examine an example for determining genealogy for the sequences in set_strings. Let us demonstrate that the optimal genealogical tree containing all seven sequences is also comprised of the optimal subtrees in the left and right branches of the parent node. \n",

These two children's node sequences will at the same time, be connected to an additional two sequences which they share the most similarity with. This implies that a children's node sequence will be connected with the three most closely related sequences to it. The leaf node sequences that are not connected to the same parent node will be most different from each other. This implies that to build the optimal global tree for a set of seven sequences, the two subtrees located at the left and right children nodes of the root must also be the optimal subtrees of the two sets of three nodes, where the leaf nodes will be most closely related to their parent and sibling, and least related to the leaf nodes in the separate subtree. \n",

That would leave (a), (d), (e) and (g) as leaf nodes. Given that this tree exhibits an optimal substructure, we must demonstrate that the optimal tree composed of all these seven nodes with root node (b) includes two optimal subtrees of root nodes (c) and (f). Following from the assumption that a most similar to another node indicates a closer relationship when constructing the subtree rooted at (c) with available nodes (a), (d), (e), (g) and (f), we would assume that the sequences identified as children nodes would be those with a longest relative LCS to (c), as the longer the LCS the more similar we would expect the sequences to be. Based on the relationships derived manually in the section above, we can see that (a) and (e) are the nodes with the highest LCS with (c), meaning that the optimal solution to the structure of this subtree, is that in which (c) is the parent node connected to (a) and (e) as children, as both (e) and (a) are also more similar to (c) than among each other or to other sequences. From this, we can conclude that the optimal solution to the problem also includes solutions to subproblems denoting an optimal substructure.\n",

Next, the parent of (x) would be identified. As this procedure follows a greedy property and (z) would be the only sequence remaining, (z) would become the parent of (x) with an LCS connection of 0.10.

Then, for each of the possible tree combinations, the function calculate_tree_score() computes the average relative LCS for that tree, by finding the average relative LCS for all the pairs of sequences that are connected in the tree. For every average relative LCS computed the algorithm compares its value with a variable that stores the highest average relative LCS encountered until then (which originally has a sentinel of negative infinity) and updates that variable with the current average relative LCS if it is bigger than the previous highest value. If this update takes place, then the variable best_tree saves the tree whose average relative LCS was just identified.

If the average relative LCS for a tree is high, it means that most if not all of the connections of sequences within the tree also have high relative LCS values themselves, meaning they are a few mutations away from each other and hence, closely related. By maximizing the average relative LCS value of a tree, we are also maximizing how closely related pairs of sequences that are linked are, meaning that if all links are maximized, the resulting genealogical tree will be the correct representation of the sequences of mutations that a parent node underwent to produce all other sequences. \n",

    "The lcs_length() function has a time complexity of $Big-Theta(m_1.m_2)$ where m_1 is the number of characters in one of the sequences and m_2 is the number of characters in the other sequence for which we are computing the length of the LCS. This is the case as the algorithm fills in a matrix with shape (n1, n2) through a dynamic programming approach in which it takes $Big-Theta(1)$ time to compute the value for each cell in the matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relative_lcs_matrix() function has a time complexity of $O(n^2) x Big-Theta(m_1. m_2)$ as the algorithm runs two nested for loops to iterate through the number of sequences for which the relative LCSs are being computed while calculating each pair of sequences' respective relative LCS by first computing their LCS, which as demonstrated above takes $Big-Theta(m_1.m_2)$ times. This can be simplified to $O((n^2).(m^2))$ where n is the number of sequences and m is the number of characters in each sequence. \n",

    "\n",
    "The genealogy_local() algorithm includes the function fix_violations() which takes $O(n^3)$ time to run, where n is the number of nodes that need to be fixed, due to the retrieval of the maximum relative LCS of the parent node to be fixed with any given sequence, while still checking that the selected node is available to become a child node. In the case that no nodes are violating the children-to-parent node ratio, the procedure takes $O(n)$ time to confirm that indeed no violations have happened. Taking this into account, we can determine the scaling behavior of the genealogy_local() algorithm. This procedure will take $O(n^3)$ time, where n is the number of sequences whose genealogical tree we are constructing. This is because to determine the genealogy of all nodes at a certain height of the tree, it iterates through the number of nodes that should be at that height of the tree and identifies the node with maximum relative LCS to the current node while checking that it is still available. This process occurs once with all leaf nodes and a second time with all remaining non-leaf nodes, potentially fixing violations between the two sections, which means that the largest number of iterations of a for loop with two nested for loops will be n/2 (the number of leaf nodes) where n is the number of sequences whose genealogy we are reconstructing. \n",

    "The genealogy_global() algorithm includes the function generate_trees() which because it must generate all possible permutations of a tree comprised of the number of sequences, takes $O(n!)$ time where n is the number of sequences input. The function calculate_tree_scores() will take $O(n)$ time, where n is the number of input sequences, to retrieve the relative LCS lengths of all pairs of sequences in a given tree, as it will iterate through n/2 parent sequences and retrieve the relative LCS lengths of each with both its children. Taking this into account, we can derive that the overall time complexity of the genealogy_global algorithm will be $O(n!.n)$ where n is the number of input sequences, as the procedure will iterate through all possible combinations of trees (which we have shown to take $O(n!)$), and for each of them compute their scores which takes $O(n)$ time.\n",

This means that the asymptotically scaling behavior defined by $O((n^2).(m^2))$ where n is the number of sequences and m is the number of characters in each sequence will affect the production of the matrix for both equally. Thus, to experimentally corroborate the differences in scaling behavior between the local greedy algorithm and the global brute force approach, the experimental simulations conducted time the performance of the algorithmic procedure only. \n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce noise in the calculation of runtime for both algorithms, the simulation will perform ten experiments for each input size. Ideally, more experiments would yield better results, but due to the high computational demands of the algorithm, a good enough value of ten was chosen. Both algorithms are run on increasing input sizes, which are determined by the number of levels in the tree (height +1). This means that if the input size is three, n=3, the maximum number of sequences on which the local and global algorithms will run is $(2^n) - 1 = 7$. Because the brute force approach computes all permutations of the input sequences, the maximum input size possible for running experiments on this algorithm was a tree height of 2, which means 7 sequences and 5040 permutations. As soon as the input size is increased past that, the number of permutations becomes 1307674368000 which makes it impossible to run the brute force algorithm. Consequently, I performed separate experiments on the greedy algorithm with larger input sizes (up to a tree height of six). \n",
    "\n",
    "Although very limited, these experimental results corroborate the derived theoretical complexity. We can observe how even with a small input size of seven sequences, there is a very large difference between the average runtime of the local greedy algorithm and the global brute force one. This contrast is shown in Figure 5., where it almost seems as if the greedy algorithm runs in constant time due to the large difference in runtimes which is not captured by the scale properly. Hence, we must zoom into the curve representing the average runtime of the local greedy algorithm. This is shown in Figure 6. When doing so, we see that the curve is actually not linear, but rather the average runtime increases significantly relative to the previous data points. This behavior is best captured in Figure 7, which shows the scaling behavior of the local greedy algorithm on a larger input size (up to 127 sequences). \n",
    "\n",
    "This scaling behavior is best understood by looking at the impact that doubling the input size has on runtime. The employment of Big-O notation represents the asymptotic upper bound to an algorithm's scaling behavior. This means that we would expect the average runtime of an algorithm at most to be close to the value determined by the factor of growth of the asymptotic notation, while never becoming higher, or crossing this 'asymptotic curve'. What this means for each of our algorithms is that we would expect the change in average runtime of the local greedy algorithm to change by at most $O(n^3)$ and the average runtime of the global brute force approach by at most $O(n!.n)$ where n is the number of sequences whose genealogy we are computing in both cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, this means that for an input size increase of height 1 to height 2, so a change in the number of sequences from 3 to 7, we would expect the average runtime of the local greedy algorithm to change by at most, approximately 12.7. Our experimental runtime instead shows a change in runtime by approximately 4.3. However, this is not a particularly accurate representation of the algorithm's behavior, as an input size of 3 almost has no computational costs involved in identifying the parent sequence for the two leaf nodes. It is important to note that due to a shortfall in the implementation of the local greedy algorithm, the function was adapted to run the experiments by including a try, except statement. This may alter the experimental results of running the algorithm slightly, compared to the expected results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For an input size increase of height 1 to height 2, so a change in the number of sequences from 3 to 7, we would expect the average runtime of the global brute force approach, to change by a factor of at most 1960.0. Our experimental results are well within this bound with a change in average runtime of approximately 1288. All these calculations can be found in Appendix H. \n",

    "**Understanding optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate which algorithmic strategy is preferable in determining the genealogical relationship between a set of sequences, let us employ the concept of optimization. Optimization is the process of determining the local or global extrema (either minima or maxima) within a set of solutions that fit within a problem's constraints. To identify such extrema, we must characterize the problem clearly defining the variable to be optimized, the variables that can be altered in search of that optimal value, and the set of constraints shaping the problem at hand. Depending on how we define our optimization problem, we will prefer an algorithmic strategy over the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: We pursue the optimization of local similarity, meaning that for every sequence within the set of sequences in our problem, we aim to identify another sequence most similar to it. The optimization variable to be maximized in this case would be the relative LCS length between the two sequences, as we have assumed that the higher the relative LCS of two sequences, the more similar the two sequences are. The main decision variable within this definition of the problem is the sequence with which to pair any given sequence, as depending on which sequences are paired together, their relative LCS length will change. This problem has one significant constraint: a sequence can at most be paired with three other sequences, due to the binary structure of the genealogical tree. If that given sequence is located at a leaf node of the genealogical tree it will only be connected to one other sequence, and if it is located at the root of the genealogical tree it will only be connected to two other sequences. This means that once a sequence has had three other sequences identified as the most similar to it, it becomes unavailable for other sequences to consider being paired with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If local similarity were to be our optimization objective when employing an algorithmic strategy to construct genealogy, we would not prioritize ensuring that all connections of the tree represent the correct direct relations, but rather, that each node is paired with the (at most three) sequences available that are most similar to it. As explained in the sections above, this may or may not result in the correct global optimal tree. However, this should not be a problem if our optimization variable remains locally similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2: We pursue the optimization of global genealogy mapping, meaning that we aim to identify the genealogical tree that best represents the process by which an original parent sequence underwent multiple instances of mutations to give rise to different generations of sequences, where each time a sequence mutates it does so by producing two new sequences. The optimization variable to be maximized in this case would be the average relative LCS length for all the connections of sequences within the genealogical tree, as we can infer that the higher the average LCS length of all connections, the more related to each other most combinations of pairs must be. For this definition of the problem, the main decision variable is not each choice of sequence that maximizes the relative LCS for a given sequence, but rather the combination of all sequences, ensuring that we do not encounter the constraint of one sequence not being available after it has been assigned to another sequence. Although this characterization of the problem avoids the constraint present when optimizing the local similarity, it presents a significant obstacle. The computational cost of such optimization is very high. It could vary depending on the implementation, but it would for sure be more costly than optimizing for the local similarity, as the number of combinations considered to optimize the global genealogy becomes very high. \n",
    "\n",
    "If global genealogy mapping were to be our optimization objective, when employing an algorithmic strategy to construct genealogy, we would make sure to check all possible combinations of sequences in a tree, to ensure we select the one that yields the best reconstruction of genealogical relationships.\n",

    "Case 3: We pursue the optimization of computational resources, meaning that we aim to minimize the space and time complexities of our algorithmic strategy when solving the problem of genealogical reconstruction. For this report, I will discuss the optimization variable of time complexity (although space complexity or a combination of the two would also inform such an optimization problem). For this definition of the problem, the main decision variables are the algorithmic implementation itself, and within it, the metric employed to construct the genealogy. The main obstacle of this optimization problem, which can become a constraint in certain cases is the computational resources of the hardware in which the algorithm is running. Another obstacle is that the output of the algorithmic implementation could be hardly aligned with the problem at hand, determining the genealogical tree of a set of sequences, depending on which metric is employed in the algorithmic strategy. \n",
    "\n",

    "**Strategy choice**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have identified the three main optimization objectives that we could consider, let us evaluate which of the two implemented approaches: a local, greedy algorithm or a global, brute force algorithm, we would choose in each case. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the optimization objective in Case 1: optimizing for local similarity, we would prefer to employ the local, greedy algorithm. This algorithm will employ the metric of relative LCS between each pair of sequences, to for every given sequence, identify another sequence that is most similar to. This is a sensible choice if we would like to construct a genealogical tree through simple, greedy choices for each subproblem within our main problem, and we are willing to take the risk of not reaching the global optimal genealogical tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the optimization objective in Case 2: optimizing for global genealogy mapping, we would prefer to employ the global brute force algorithm. This algorithm will make sure to generate all possible permutations of sequences to construct a genealogical tree and employ the metric of average relative LCS for all sequence combinations within the tree to identify the tree that best represents the order in which parent sequences mutated into children sequences. This is a sensible choice if we would like to construct the optimal genealogical tree, ensuring the global optimal solution is reached. However, as the input size increases, the computational demands of such an algorithm will be very high. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the optimization objective in Case 3: optimizing the computational resources employed in reconstructing the genealogical relationship between a set of sequences we would likely almost always prefer the local, greedy approach. As shown in the complexity analysis section above, the local greedy approach's scaling behavior is $O(n^3)$ while the global brute force approach's scaling behavior is $O(n!.n)$, where n is the number of sequences in both cases. Because both algorithms assume the completeness of the genealogical tree, the input sizes will increase by $(2^n)-1$. This means that input sizes will be n=1, n=3, n=7, n=15, and so on. Although the brute force may be able to run in a reasonable amount of time for small input sizes (n=7 already takes around 0.96473 seconds to run though), the local greedy algorithm is also likely to output the global optimal solution. As soon as n becomes larger than 7, the brute force algorithm starts taking days or even years, depending on the computational power of the hardware employed, to produce its output (for example for n=15, the algorithm would have to evaluate fifteen factorial, $15!=1307674368000$, tree permutations)! In practice, it is probably worth taking the risk of not obtaining the optimal global output, for the sake of obtaining an answer in a relatively short amount of time, especially as input size increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the complexity of these two algorithmic approaches could be optimized further. For example, the local greedy algorithm's time complexity could be reduced to $O(n^2)$ relatively easily by implementing the extraction of the highest relative LCS length for a given sequence more efficiently, potentially through the use of priority queue data structures. The global algorithm could benefit from the implementation of a different strategy, potentially storing tree combinations and their values so that redundant combinations that represent the same tree need not be generated. Nonetheless, because multiple permutations of trees would still need to be generated, the time complexity of this algorithm is likely to still be larger than for the greedy approach. "

The probabilities of each of these scenarios can be named p_insertion, p_deletion, p_mutation. \n",

    "Given that this dataset is comprised of seven sequences only, the following approximations of the probabilities of these three types of mutations will not be too accurate and meaningful. However, they can still provide us with a general understanding of the mutation process and its implications in the genealogy calculations for the sequence. \n",

    "To start with, let us examine the tree produced by our different local and global algorithms, which indicates that (b) was the parent sequence from which (c) and (f) mutated. These last two themselves underwent mutations to give rise to (a) and (e) and (g) and (d) respectively. By looking at the length of the resulting sequences after a parent sequence underwent mutation relative to the parent sequence, we can identify the average length change relative to the given original sequence. By looking at these values we can infer that at each new generation, the sequences become longer which means that insertions are more likely to occur than deletions. As shown in Appendix F, the variable avg_len_change stores the calculated mean of the lengths of each sequence relative to its parent. When subtracting 1 to this value we obtain the percentage\n",
    "in the percentage point difference between the probability of a deletion and an insertion occurring. The resulting value means that it is approximately 8% more likely for an insertion to happen compared to a deletion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can look at the LCS length of each parent sequence and one of its children at a time. The variable lcs_relative_parent holds the mean of the LCSs of each parent sequence and its children, which is obtained by dividing each LCS by the length of the parent sequence. When subtracting this average from one, we obtain the LCS length relative to the original string. This value yields approximately a 90% average overlap between the original sequence and its longest common subsequence with its children, which means that the remaining 10% accounts for the part of the child sequence that underwent either deletions or mutations on average. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that deletions and mutations can be estimated to occur on average, 10% of the times that a sequence replicates itself to produce children and that insertions are 8% more likely to occur than deletions, we can estimate the following imperfect but proximate probabilities that a given character of a sequence will undergo insertion, deletion or mutation events. p_deletion and p_mutation must be within the 10% range. Given that we do not know their probabilities, we can safely assume that each accounts for half of that probability. Additionally, p_insertion must have an additional 8% to that of p_deletion. As a result:\n",

    "There are certain limitations to this study. Firstly, some of the conclusions derived are influenced by the small input size of our problem, given that set_strings only involve seven sequences. For example, the estimations of mutation event probabilities are very inaccurate, given the small sample size. When run on set_strings, the local greedy algorithm produces the optimal global output, but it is important to note that this may be misleading, and for different inputs, this may not be the case. Additionally, there are certain edge cases that the algorithm does not handle properly at the moment. The function fix_violations() is a correct procedure to ensure that the children-to-parent sequence ratio is maintained as 2:1. However, the local greedy algorithm only calls this after computing the relationships of leaf nodes, fixing the violations that could potentially happen for only half of the inputted sequences. Further research would be necessary to figure out where and how exactly to call fix_violations() in the while loop that determines genealogy for all non-leaf nodes to ensure that the correct available nodes are still in the dictionary from which relative LCSs are retrieved. Another significant limitation of this study was posed by my laptop's computing power constraint, and the physical time available to produce this paper. It would have been ideal to run more experimental tests on the brute force algorithm to increase the input size and evaluate its effect on the algorithm's scaling behavior. However, doing so, having to generate factorial permutations of the input sequences results in astronomical running times that neither my laptop can support, nor I can wait for. Thus, it would be recommended to run further experiments on hardware with larger computational power. Alternatively, implementing a different algorithmic strategy to employ a global metric when computing genealogy would also address this limitation. \n",

It helped me type faster but the logic behind the code was always produced by me. "
